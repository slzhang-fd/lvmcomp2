Fast estimation for latent variable model using unified stochastic proximal algorithms

# Description
Provides stochastic approximation algorithms for latent variable models
with a high-dimensional latent space and constraints/penalties on parameters. 
So far, we provide functions for confirmatory item
factor analysis based on the multidimensional two parameter logistic (M2PL) model.
The computation is facilitated by multiprocessing 'OpenMP' API.
